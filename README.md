This code is not yet finished. If you want to help me, please go ahead. The problem with this code is that it only works when you add item number 1 to the cart. It functions properly in terms of quantity and whether you want to add more orders or not. However, if you choose a number other than 1, it is automatically executed immediately. Please take a look at the problem with the code. There's a screenshot showing the part of the code that is not working. I would be grateful if someone could assist me with this. This is our old school project where we were assigned to create a system project in Python. I converted it into Java and continued development. However, I'm facing difficulties since I don't have a strong programming background. I'm a first-year student of BSIT.
